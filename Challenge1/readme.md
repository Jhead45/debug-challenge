A friend of yours is working on some coding challenges and is asking you for help. 
The first challenge is the classic fizzbuzz. Your friend has hit a couple hiccups while testing his code.
He seems unsure of the instructions and has begun to work out of order. 

Challenges

1) Your friend is unable to get 'fizzbuzz' to appear. Can you fix it?
2) n is not printing to the console. Make the correction.
3) As an added instruction have the code print 'Challenge Complete' instead of i when it is the same as n or greater than n.
4) Your friend has written a function that will generate a random number from 0 to 99 and return it if it is less than n. 
    Your friend is testing the function and occasinally getting undefined when using console.log(num). Prevent this result.
5) The last extra instruction for this 'fizzbuzz' is to reassign the variable n with the random number function when 'fizzbuzz' is written to the console.
    Your friend reminds you that he is currently using const for n and that he should be using let if he is going to reassign it. 
    (HINT: The end point of the fizzbuzz should change and not remain 99.)
