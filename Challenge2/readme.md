You just got your first dev job. Congrats!
After the first couple days your supervisor does a code review and tells you that he doesn't like
mutating variables. He asks you to rewrite a simple code and quit using for loops.

Challanges

1) Comment out the for loop and uncomment the forEach loop. Why doesnt this work? Find a way to re-write the code so that it works and doesnt mutate a variable.
2) When the counting stops at your favorite number write a forEach loop counting backwards from 10 to 0. (HINT: You can use the nums array).
3) When your loop gets to zero you should use the blastOff helper function. Why does the statment
in the blastOff function not increment correctly? Fix it.
4) Re-write the blastOff function so that you are not mutating variables.
5) When blastOff finishes its loop have it set the toggle to true.
