Your employer is asking you to write a browser extension that will automaticly place your lunch order with a company that delivers food to the office everyday. Since the company is invoiced for it all you have to do is load the page and it will place the order. 

For this challenge keep the first name, last name, and qty variables. Open the HTML page in your browser for this challenge. You will not need to touch the actual html code.

Challenge 

1) We need to set the code to only run on a certain url. Otherwise we are running it all the time. Set that up now.
2) Seems like your having filling the text inputs. What happens when you console.log the input elements? (Ex: console.log(input1) ) You should be able to see text in the text boxes.
3) You have written some code that will check to make sure the inputs are correct before filling in the time and clicking the button. Your having issues getting it to work. Also note the input type is "number", but it seems that this rule is ignored by JavaScript.
4) Fix the code that changes the option for time. We want a delivery at 2.
5) Test the code for the time slots and make sure you can change all options by altering the time variable. Add something to click the button after the options selected.
